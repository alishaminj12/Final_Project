Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)

Introduction:

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) annually sends a series of questions to each state in the United States to understand and measure behavioral risk factors for people 18 and older. This is a collaboration between US states and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that has existed since 1984. BRFSS extensively collects data on preventive health care practices, risk behaviors associated with chronic diseases, and other factors that influence US habits and access to health care.

The dataset is huge, so there is plenty of scope to study the habits, health, and lifestyle of people in different states. As part of our project, we will use this data to analyze and compare access to health care, habits and lifestyle choices, and to establish associations with heart disease, such as smoking cases in the country. 

The aim to Our goal is to compare statewide data and see how ease of choice and access to health care facilities correlate with disease incidence in the state. This may also help find answers as to which states have more cases and why? What demographics are most affected? Also lifestyle choices. makes a difference?
